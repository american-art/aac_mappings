### Problem Statement:

One major contributor to usefulness of LOD is the use of consistent, machine-readable definitions of rights.  This applies both to the content, to linked images, and to the LOD itself.

How are we mapping these rights, and what vocabularies will we use?

### Best Practice:

*To Be Determined*

### Discussion:

*(From David)*

Can we map institution rights statements to <http://rightsstatements.org>; will we need to change the browse app's functionality based on institutional image rights?

*(From Rob)*

The Getty is embarking on this route at the moment as well, and would welcome broader community discussion of the implications of adoption.

*(From Rob, via email, 9/19/2016)*

I'm very interested in this one.  In particular, creditline is important to capture and I don't see anywhere in CRM to put it.
